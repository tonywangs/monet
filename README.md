# monet

We built Monet, which is an AI design assistant designed to fast-track the workflows of project managers, marketers, and graphic designers. Monet utilizes multimodal audio integrated with the novel OpenAI tools like o1, taking in natural language text in order to function-call the graphic design API. We hope that our tool can democratize and increase the accessibility of graphic design.
